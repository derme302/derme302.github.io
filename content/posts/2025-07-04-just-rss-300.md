I've just released [Just RSS 3.0.0](https://github.com/frostcube/just-rss/discussions/71) on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frostcube.justrss) and [Testflight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/WsfbPUH1). Since starting work on Just RSS I've been passionate about adding OPML support to make it easier to migrate to Just RSS and then if your collection grows enough to migrate away easily. I see Just RSS as very much as a person's first RSS reader app or for someone that only has a few feeds in their collection.

Along with that that the update brings support for the latest versions of iOS and Android. With UI improvements across the entire app, including making the bookmark page match the main feed design. Adding new sources is also simplified.

The next big update will be to improve the onboarding experience and getting the app stable enough to leave open beta.
