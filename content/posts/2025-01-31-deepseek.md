So The Chinese startup DeepSeek rocked the US stock market this week with their R1 reasoning model. The big things that caused this are:

- Their claimed lower training cost: $5.6 million vs $80-$100+ million to train ChatGPT 4 (A good thing to note here is that cost is only final training run not cumulative)
- Beating ChatGPTs 4 o1 (Sold at $200/month) on most major AI benchmarks (See attached image)
- Lower running cost compared to ChatGPT (Based on compute dollars)

Now the media has overhyped this a little as this is not a fair comparison. DeepSeek is impressive,  however it has been benchmarked against ChatGPT 4 o1 model, where as a more fair comparison would be ChatGPT4 o3. ChatGPT 4 o3 was benchmarked with a 6x improvement on o1.

## Unsolvable AI problems

What does a AI benchmark look like? Here is an example of an unsolvable AI problem, one which you might find really easy but an AI finds really hard. This is still unsolvable by the state of the art models, including ChatGPT 4 o3 as of December 2024. The AI is shown example input/output and then asked to solve it.
