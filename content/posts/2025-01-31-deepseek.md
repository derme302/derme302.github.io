So The Chinese startup DeepSeek rocked the US stock market this week with their R1 reasoning model. The big things that caused this are:

- Their claimed lower training cost: $5.6 million vs $80-$100+ million to train ChatGPT 4 (A good thing to note here is that cost is only final training run not cumulative)
- Beating ChatGPTs 4 o1 (Sold at $200/month) on most major AI benchmarks (See attached image)
- Lower running cost compared to ChatGPT (Based on compute dollars)

Now the media has overhyped this a little as this is not a fair comparison. DeepSeek is impressive,  however it has been benchmarked against ChatGPT 4 o1 model, where as a more fair comparison would be ChatGPT4 o3. ChatGPT 4 o3 was benchmarked with a 6x improvement on o1.
